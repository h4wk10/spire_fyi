Spire is a Solana-focused on-chain data platform that aims to provide in-depth data and insights to add value to the Solana ecosystem. 
Focusing on analyses we think are interesting, we provide a place where users and developers can regularly check for Solana ecosytem information, as well as deeper dives into specific areas.

## Overview
Spire is a work in progress and in active development.

We use [`streamlit`](https://streamlit.io/) to build our interactive dashboard.

Historical data is sourced from [Flipside Crypto](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/) using their [SDK](https://sdk.flipsidecrypto.xyz/shroomdk).
Queries used for this can be found [here](sql).

[Helius](https://helius.xyz/) is used to acquire NFT metadata information, essential for NFT royalty analyses.

### Projects
- [NFT Royalty analysis](https://spire.fyi/NFT_Royalties): Which users pay royalties when this is optional? What is the potential loss in revenue from royalties?
- [Program usage analysis](https://spire.fyi/Program_Usage): What are the top Solana programs used per day? How is this different for new users vs all users?

- Coming soon:
  - Network analysis of Program usage
